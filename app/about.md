<p class="govuk-body-l">
A single point of reference to guide all software development across HMRC.
</p>

<hr class="govuk-section-break--l govuk-section-break--visible">

## Purpose

HMRC makes use of a range of different technologies across its estate. However, we believe there are unifying principles, standards and practices that apply broadly across these. This site is meant to provide a singular point of reference for both staff and suppliers alike, and help improve quality and consistency across all areas of the organisation.

In some contexts, it may not be feasible or sensible to apply all principles, standards and practices in a standardised way. You should consider this guidance within the context in which you are working.
