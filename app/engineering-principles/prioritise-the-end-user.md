## Motivation

Whilst work may be motivated by business needs, we should always be considering what users need -- otherwise we risk building software that doesn't work for its users, and doesn't deliver the desired benefits.

<hr class="govuk-section-break--l govuk-section-break--visible">

## Applying this principle

- When building or changing software, ensure you know who the users are and understand their expectations.
- User research is a team sport -- regardless of profession, we expect all team members engage with user research activity, working in collaboration with a professional user researcher.
- Where user research isn't feasible, look to performance analytics to provide insights -- ideally before you start implementing change.
- Design for diverse user needs and ensure that software is usable by people with accessibility requirements.
