<p class="govuk-body-l">
Always factor in time to maintain technical health, repaying technical debt on a consistent basis. Apply curiosity to new technologies and diligently evaluate how they address known problems, adding real value to our users.

## Motivation

By frequently considering the technical health of our software, we can make better decisions about how and when to address shortcomings, and improve our service offering. This also allows us to better understand how new technology may help overcome known, well-understood problems.

<hr class="govuk-section-break--l govuk-section-break--visible">

## Applying this principle

- Clearly communicate when short-term decisions result in technical debt, make a plan about when it will be addressed, and ensure it is tracked in a way that reduces the risk of it being forgotten.
- Evaluate new technologies against their ability to address known problems in a way that will benefit us or our users, applying a data-driven approach where possible.
