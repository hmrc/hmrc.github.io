Build trust through open communication, managing risks collaboratively and sharing progress honestly. Highlight challenges early and demonstrate how they're being addressed.

## Motivation

Being honest with stakeholders builds trust and promotes better ways of working, where teams and stakeholders have mutual respect for each other and understand their shared constraints. Challenges that are well understood by both parties can be handled collaboratively, leading to better overall outcomes for our users.

## Applying this principle

- Encourage cross-functional teams who collaborate and share knowledge.
- Establish a regular cadence of sessions to "show the thing", including demonstrating the user research that led to particular decisions.
- Make good use of workshops to bring together different stakeholder groups -- like policy, operational and technology colleagues -- and reach a common understanding of how the overall solution will help users.
- Communicate blockers and problems openly, to allow informed decisions to be made about potential mitigations and enable accurate messaging to users who may be affected.
