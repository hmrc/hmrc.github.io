Leverage virtualisation to create production-like test environments that enable reliable testing. Ensure the tools and resources needed for testing are in place, supporting effective and efficient validation.

## Motivation

Having a production-like environment to test in is essential to gain confidence prior to releasing change. It ensures test results are representative, reducing the risk of bugs and potential impacts on users.

## Applying this principle

- Ensure that platforms have representative test environments available for use by teams.
- Where possible, environments should be virtualised and ephemeral - being created when needed and torn down again once testing is complete.
- Consider how availability of test data may affect the testing teams are able to complete.
