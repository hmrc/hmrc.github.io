## Motivation

By applying internal and external standards, we help ensure consistency across our estate, improve quality and increase interoperability. We must also to understand and meet relevant legal standards.

<hr class="govuk-section-break--l govuk-section-break--visible">

## Applying this principle

- Consider what existing external standards exist for the tools and technology you are using, and consider contributing to internal interpretations of these where relevant.
- Be mindful of legal standards such as GDPR and how they affect our ability to handle user data.
- Engage and inform internal processes that ensure compliance with legal requirements, such as Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and Security Risk Assessments (SRAs).
