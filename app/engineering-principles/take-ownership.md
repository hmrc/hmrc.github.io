<p class="govuk-body-l">
Embrace a "you build it, you run it" mindset, ensuring quality, observability and testing are embedded into processes, maintain responsibility until services meet agreed standards.

## Motivation
The people with the most knowledge about a service and how it works are those who built it, therefore they are best placed to support it in a live environment. By providing that team with qualitative and quantitative feedback, they are able to incrementally improve the service to create a better user experience.

## Applying this principle

- Equip teams with the knowledge and tools required to manage their own service in production, including access to appropriate data to diagnose problems themselves.
- Empower teams to manage their own release processes, with appropriate guard rails or controls where needed.
- Ensure there are clear expectations set around what quality is expected for the tools and technologies being used.
