## Requirement(s)
- [You MUST have agreed availability expectations](#you-must-have-agreed-availability-expectations)
- [You MUST monitor availability](#you-must-monitor-availability)

### You MUST have agreed availability expectations

By working with your users and stakeholders, you must agree what level of availability is expected and ensure the support arrangements are suitable for this -- for example, the days and hours that support will be provided.

### You MUST monitor availability

Using observability tooling you must be able to understand when your service is and isn't available, and agree with stakeholders what reporting requirements they may have.
