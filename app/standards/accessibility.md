### You MUST include an accessibility statement on websites and in apps

An accessibility statement helps users better understand how they can interact with your website or app, and any difficulties they may face when they try to do so. It also provides information about how they can report further accessibility problems, to help you iterate and improve.

### You MUST implement an approach to accessibility testing

There are a range of different freely available accessibility testing tools you can use to identify some types of accessibility issues. These allow you to reduce the risk of introducing problems that may cause issues for users, prior to releasing changes to production. You may use these in a manual or automated way, but should ensure that accessibility testing is performed regularly.

### You MUST perform your own accessibility testing prior to an accessibility audit

Accessibility audits are time consuming and should be focussed on finding complex issues that you may not have the tools or expertise to find yourself through accessibility testing. They should rarely find simple accessibility failures, as these will be identified by your own regular accessibility testing.

### You MUST engage with the relevant HMRC accessibility team

HMRC has two teams responsible for undertaking accessibility audits and producing accessibility statements that meet legal and policy requirements, as well as providing guidance around accessibility more generally. You should follow guidance relevant to your area to determine which team you need to work with to arrange an audit and to get an accessibility statement produced.
