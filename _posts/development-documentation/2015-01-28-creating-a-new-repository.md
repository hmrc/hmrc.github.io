## Creating a New Repository
The process of creating a new repository is automated and peformed through a job in Jenkins Open which uses [init-repository](https://github.com/hmrc/init-repository).

init-repository currently performs the following tasks:

- Creates a new [github.com/hmrc](https://github.com/hmrc) repositiory and gives write access to a given team
- Creates bintray packages

###Steps
1. Go to the 'create-a-release' job in Jenkins Open
2. Enter the name of your new repository and the team to which it will belong. The team must be the exact text that apepars on [the teams page](https://github.com/orgs/hmrc/teams) (login required)
3. Run the job

###Result
- A git tag of version v0.1.0
- [https://bintray.com/hmrc/](Bintray.com) releases and release-candidates packages 
- .gitignore
- .travis.yml
- README.md containing badges for Bintray and Travis

###Next Steps
- Ask a platform lead to enable your job in Travis
- Add a Jenkins Open job for your new repository in [https://github.com/hmrc/jenkins-jobs](jenkins-jobs) and re-seed Jenkins Open
- Add some useful information about your new repository to the readme
- If your repository is a library add the following to the end of the README, updating <ARTEFACT-NAME> with the name of your artifact (NOTE: leave the text '[INSERT-VERSION]' in the README, the actual version will show on the Bintray badge):

      resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("hmrc", "releases")
      libraryDependencies += "uk.gov.hmrc" %% "<ARTEFACT-NAME>" % "[INSERT-VERSION]"
